# Virtual Assistant using Zapier + Langchain

Welcome to the Virtual Assistant project that combines the power of Zapier and Langchain to create an intelligent and efficient assistant capable of natural language interactions and task automation. 

See it in my [blog](https://my-personal-website-git-main-giabaocorn20.vercel.app/blog/build-a-virtual-assistant)

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of two cutting-edge technologies: Zapier for workflow automation and Langchain for conversational AI. By combining these tools, we've built a virtual assistant that not only understands and responds to user queries but also performs a wide range of actions across different platforms.

## Features

- **Conversational AI**: The assistant powered by Langchain engages in natural conversations with users, comprehending queries and generating relevant responses.
  
- **Workflow Automation**: Zapier automates tasks across multiple applications, allowing the assistant to execute actions like sending emails, searching the web, and more.

- **Voice Interaction (Optional)**: The project includes an optional voice recording feature that lets users interact with the assistant through spoken language.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-assistant.git`.

2. Install the necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Obtain API keys for OpenAI (Langchain) and Zapier. Set these keys in the appropriate places in the code.

4. Configure your Zapier workflows to enable seamless integration with the assistant.

5. Run the main script and start interacting with the virtual assistant through the command line or voice recording (if enabled).

## Tools and Libraries Used

- [Langchain](https://www.langchain.com): Provides the conversational AI capabilities for the virtual assistant.

- [Zapier](https://www.zapier.com): Enables workflow automation and integration with various applications.

- [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/): Used for language processing and understanding.

- [Sounddevice](https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/): Utilized for voice recording functionality (optional).
